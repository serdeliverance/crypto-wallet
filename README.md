## Run the app

1. Start containers using docker compose:

```
docker-compose up
```

2. Run the application

You'll need to have configured the following env variables before running the app:

* `DB_URL`
* `DB_USER`
* `DB_PASSWORD`
* `COINMARKETCAP_URL`: [Coinmaerkap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) api url
* `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY`: you have to generate one API KEY on [Coinmaketcap Web Site](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)

Then execute:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

It runs the application on http://localhost:8080


## Database migrations

We use [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) for database migrations. It runs the migration on application startup, so remember to have the dockers up when running the app.

## Formatting & Coding Style

This project uses [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) to enforce a consistent programming style. Under the hood, it is configured to use [Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format). We have the following commands:

* check formatting violations:

```
./gradlew spotlessCheck
```

* apply formatting:

```
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

By default, this plugin is attached to the `verify phase` of maven lifecycle.

## Extra notes

* A ready [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) is provided. It contains all the components ready for local development. It also contains dummy data for playing around with the app.

* Also, a [postman collection](postman-collection/crypto.postman_collection.json) is provided.
